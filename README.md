# Counter

## Description

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS counter web-based application. It allows users to increment and decrement a numerical value with intuitive button clicks, arrow key presses, or mouse wheel actions. The counter's state is preserved across page reloads and browser sessions using `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement**: Users can modify the counter value using on-screen buttons.
- **Keyboard Support**: The up (`↑`) and down (`↓`) arrow keys, along with the right (`→`) and left (`←`) arrow keys, can be used for incrementing and decrementing respectively.
- **Scroll Interaction**: Scrolling up increases the counter, while scrolling down decreases it.
- **Persistent State**: The counter retains its value even after the browser is closed or the page is reloaded, thanks to `localStorage`.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset button allows users to set the counter back to zero.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Mintellect310/Counter.git
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start using the counter.

## Usage

- Click the `+` button or press the `↑` or `→` arrow keys to increment the counter.
- Click the `-` button or press the `↓` or `←` arrow keys to decrement the counter.
- Scroll up or down over the counter display to increment or decrement respectively.
- Click the `RESET` button or press `Enter` to reset the counter to zero.
